# meal

Something eaten or drunk, one row per eating. Born September 19, 2026 from
"Track 1, Kirtland Signatures, Carmel S'mores Cluster." The week already held two
dozen untyped food notes, so the kind was born here and those rows were re-filed
under it.

props:  items (list) - portion (string, as he said it) - kcal (number) -
        protein_g (number) - place - meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack) -
        basis (how the numbers were arrived at) - assumed (list) - sources (list of URLs)

enrich: when he does not weigh or say, estimate kcal and protein from typical
        portions and put the basis next to the number on the wrist. A brand and
        product name means label numbers, not an estimate. Day totals are never
        stored on a row - they come from
        `records --kind meal --from ... --agg sum:kcal,count --by day`.

ask:    "how many calories today"; "how much protein this week";
        "when did I last eat X"; calories and protein per day.

notes:  he opens with "Track" or "Log". A second helping of the same thing a few
        minutes later updates the same row rather than filing a new one. He names
        brands often, and the label beats an estimate. Transcription mangles brand
        names ("Kirtland Signatures" for Kirkland Signature) - resolve them and say
        what was resolved.
        A bare number in a Track note is the count of that helping, not a running
        total for the day. On September 19, 2026 "Track 11: Jesus." was read as a
        running count and the cluster row was raised to eleven; he corrected it to
        three nine minutes later. When a number looks like a jump, keep the helpings
        already counted and say what was assumed.
